# Summary
This repository contains electronic schematic and firmware for a binary clock made with AVR ATMega32 MCU.

For the complete description of the project please see this [blog article](http://null-b.blogspot.ca/2012/06/avr.html) (or its [English version by Google Translate](http://null-b.blogspot.ca/2012/06/avr.html)).

# Repository Contents
- `schematic.png`: image with electronic schematic of the device.
- `PCB_600dpi.png`: monochrome image with printed circuit board. It only contains traces and pads so it can be used to manufacture PCB.
- `src`: directory that contains source code for the firmware (files `binary_clock.asm` and `binary_clock.inc`) and AVR Studio 4 project (file `binary_clock.aps`).
- `schematic`: directory that contains schematic and PCB projects for Eagle CAD.
